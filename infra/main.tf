/**
 * The published report: a private bucket behind a delivery network.
 *
 * The bucket blocks all public access. Only the distribution can read it,
 * through an origin access control, so there is exactly one way in and the
 * bucket itself is never addressable.
 *
 * Everything here is applied by the deploy job on merge to main, never from a
 * laptop. The only exception is infra/bootstrap, which creates the role this
 * job assumes and therefore cannot be created by it.
